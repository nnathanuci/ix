Table data is stored stored in heap files.

- Each page in the heap is 4096 bytes (4KB) in size.

- A page is either:
  * a control page
  * a data page

- The space needed to address a page is 12 bits. When convenient we use 2 bytes instead.

Control Pages:

- A control page tells us the amount of unused space in a data page.

- The format for a control page is as follows:
  (unused_0, unused_1, unused_2, ..., unused_n)

  * since we're representing every unused space as 2 bytes, a control page can have 2048 entries.

  * everytime we do an insert/update/deleteTuple, the correct control page needs to be updated.

  * arithmetic in rm.h explains how to determine given an absolute page id, which corresponding control page and index manages it.
